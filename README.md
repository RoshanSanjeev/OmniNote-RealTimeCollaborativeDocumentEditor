# âœ¨ OmniNote: Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor

Built by **Roshan Sanjeev**  
This is a real-time collaborative document editor built from scratch using **React**, **Flask**, and **native WebSockets**. It allows multiple users to edit a shared document simultaneously with live syncing, rich text formatting, user tracking, and version history â€” all without any external rich text or socket libraries.
